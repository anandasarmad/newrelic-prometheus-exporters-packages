# Prometheus Exporter Packages

This project packages several Prometheus exporters as native operating system packages, with the goal of providing a better installation experience for Prometheus exporters.

All native packages are available for installation in New Relic's public repositories.

## Installation

To use the packages generated by this project you need to:

- Determine your OS version.
  - Debian, Red Hat, CentOS, Amazon Linux:

    ```bash
    cat /etc/os-release
    ```

  - Ubuntu

    ```bash
    cat /etc/lsb-release
    ```

  - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server

    ```bash
    cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID
    ```

- Enable New Relic's GPG key (APT and YUM packages).
  
```bash
    curl -s https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

- Add the New Relic's repository to the operating system package manager.
  - Debian based:

    ```bash
    printf "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/apt <VERSION> main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic-infra.list
    ```

    Note: replace \<VERSION> with either **jessie**, **stretch** or **buster**, depending on your Debian version

  - YUM based (Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, RHEL, CentOS):

    ```bash
    sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/newrelic-infra.repo https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/<VERSION>/x86_64/newrelic-infra.repo
    ```

     Note:
    - for Amazon Linux replace \<VERSION> with **6** and for Amazon Linux 2 replace with **7**
    - for CentOS and RHEL, replace \<VERSION> with the version you are using, (**5**, **6**, **7** or **8**)

- Refresh the repositories.
  - Debian, Ubuntu

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

  - Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, RHEL, CentOS

    ```bash
    sudo yum -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='newrelic-infra'
    ```
  
  - SLES

    ```bash
    sudo zypper -n ref -r newrelic-infra
    ```

## Getting Started

Before installing any of the exporters, be sure to read the documentation for the specific exporter you want to install.
Each exporter may have specific configuration options that will require you to modify to make it work for your environment.

Also make sure you read the documentation about the [Infrastructure agent](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent). The agent, in conjunction with our [Prometheus Open Metrics integration](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus), is the component responsible for sending the metrics, provided by the exporter, to New Relic.

If you followed the instructions in the [installation section](#installation) you can now install the exporter using a single command.

- Ubuntu, Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install <exporter package name>
```

- Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, RHEL, CentOS

```bash
sudo yum install <exporter package name>
```

- SLES

```bash
sudo zypper install <exporter package name>
```
